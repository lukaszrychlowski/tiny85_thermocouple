Small project to learn basics of C for embedded devices. The goal is to create a temperature monitor I will use during melting of rapidly solidified Al alloys. For now I am using ATtiny85 with Pimoroni 1.12" OLED.

Heavily inspired by Technoblogy (http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2G9S) and wagiminator "i2c OLED on an Atiny10/13/202 (https://github.com/wagiminator/ATtiny13-TinyOLEDdemo)
Both links have GREAT documentation, very informative, learnt a lot!
